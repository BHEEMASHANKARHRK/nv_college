                <p style="  text-align: justify;">
                      1907, the year of inception of N.V. Society, was the year of fusion and confusion in respect of Politico-social values in the field of education. People began to have introspection on education. When the educated society began to stare with their eyes being slowly opened from the long stupor, so many lapses came to the lime light.

                      Of these multi-lapses, (foreign) English medium of education was the prime one. English language was not only used in teaching Maths, History, Geography ,and allied Science subjects but also in the teaching of language like Persian , Sanskrit etc, on the pretext of making learning simple and digestible. This had the negative effect on the students. In terms of wastage of time and knowledge, we did not realize our systematic lagging behind.
                      
                      In the Knowledge market, the ever decrease in the value of our currency caused depression in the minds of our educated lot who, in the opinion of late Prof. Gole, was not able to face the challenges either physically or mentally. Seeing the high mortality rate of the educated, a debate was on, on 'why our graduates are dying young'
                      
                      The education devoid of morality and religion and the doubtful policies of education gave way to atheism and dogmatism.
                      
                      People began to feel that their dedication alone would bring a sea change in the education system. They began to move this idea enthusiastically like the children moving wooden cart with a found of hope of early walking and running. Result of this historic move resulted in the start of many private educational institutions.
                      
                      Even in the Gulbarga elite this flow of thought was on the Late Shri. VithalRao Devlgaonkar, Late Justice Keshvarao Koratkar, Shri Girirao Anna Jahagirdar, Shri Narayanrao Ratkalkar, ware able to start a library,(a miniature) a mini societal school of education. That time library was a work-place of moral activities of the current issues. Late Shri Vithalrao was so actively generous that he used to read the thought provoking and informative passages form the newspapers, periodicals and books, loudly to the People and discuss the important ones with them. That had an effect on them and the desire for uplifting the society was ignited in them and all of them became active in serving the Society. They began to strongly feel that one can render service to the society through the media of education. There was no school to impart education through mother tongue. The already existing Marathi school had been converted into Urdu Medium School. There, A to Z was taught in Urdu medium, Marathi speaking students felt miserable. Even the same was prevalent in high school. Thousands of Rupees of the Government spent on these two schools was not able to solve the problem of the students. The elite of Gulbarga having confidence in self-help and urge for societal service decided to solve the Problem once for all.
